# OceanOptics SeaBreeze

This is the SeaBreeze library for interfacing with OceanOptics spectrometers,
originally at https://sourceforge.net/projects/seabreeze/. Forked from
https://github.com/udyni/seabreeze.

## Highlights

* Working CMake build system
* Removed binary cruft
* Compiles on Linux/gcc + clang, Windows with MinGW/MSYS2

# Remarks

Not tested on macOS. I doubt that it will compile.

Original README is in README.orig.txt.
